# Embedded-System-Morse-Code

This project programs a TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3220S to message "SOS" in morse code until a button is pressed generating a different message "OK". The programming allows for a message to finish before switching to the next message regardless of when the button is pressed to ensure that messages are not being interrupted.

This project demonstrates my ability to use embedded peripherals in a complex way. I generated state machines that break down this program in a logical and insightful way. I don't believe that there are many ways that I could improve this projects code, but I do think I could have provided more technical documentation as to how I arrived at my solution.

This project taught me a significant amount about timers, UART's and other embedded peripherals. This project has given me the knowledge needed to program embedded systems to perform desirable actions. I will be using a significant amount of what I learned in this project to program embedded systems in the future for hobby or professional reasons. 

This project was created with maintainability, readability, and adaptability in mind. The code is well commented and broken down to allow future users to clearly understand what is happening.
